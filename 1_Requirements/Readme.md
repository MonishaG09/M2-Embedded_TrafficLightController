## Introduction
The use of personal vehicles is very common now a days and a result, the number of vehicles on the roads are exponentially increasing. Roads without any supervision or guidance can lead in to traffic congestions and accidents.

Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals are signalling devices that are used to control the flow of traffic. Generally, they are positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc. and alternate the priority of who has to wait and who has to go.
## Research
The traffic lights will provide instructions to the users (drivers and pedestrians) by displaying lights of standard color.The traffic lights consist of three universal coloured lights: the green light allows traffic to proceed in the indicated direction, the yellow  light  warns  vehicles  to  prepare  for  short  stop, and the red  signal prohibits any  traffic  from  proceeding. Similarly  as  traffic light we have used four light pair of three color lights Red, Green & Yellow. These light timing is control by Atmega328 controller.
